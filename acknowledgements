Thanks to Thomas Voegtlin for creating the Electrum software and
infrastructure and for maintaining it so diligently.  Electrum is
probably the best desktop Bitcoin wallet solution for most users.  

Additionally, thanks to kyuupichan and spesmilo. The vast majority of the code is their original work and
includes some new ideas, but it is very clear that the general structure
and concept are those of Electrum.  Some parts of the code and ideas
are Electrum, while some of which it stems from other projects such as
Abe and pywallet.  Thanks to the authors of all the software
this is derived from.

Thanks to bauerj, hsmiths and JWU42 of #electrum for their
help and support in testing the versions of ElectrumX prior to ElectrumX-Dime 1.0.

Thanks to Daniel Bernstein for daemontools and other software, and to
Matthew Dillon for DragonFlyBSD.  

And of course, thanks to Satoshi for the wonderful creation that is
Bitcoin, without none of this would exist.
