This project is a fork of `spesmilo/electrumx <https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx/>`_.

ElectrumX-Dime allows users to run their own Electrum-Dime server. It connects to your
full node and indexes the blockchain, allowing efficient querying of the history of
arbitrary addresses. The server can be exposed publicly, and joined to the public network
of servers via peer discovery.
